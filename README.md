# react-native-snap-shooter
The aim of this library is to allow take snap shots of your simple demo application in various React Native versions in simplified way.

## Current status
Currently it is in very early development stage and we want to validate if community is interested in such project.

## Prerequisites
It requires all tools needed to develop and run RN applications especially following
* "shell" ( MacOS, ...)
* global `react-native-cli` at least version `0.2`

## TODO
Plan for future roughly based on priority (any help is welcomed). The code will also need more proper error handling/timeouts that hopefully will improve over time.

- [x] basic IOS prototype for taking snapshots/screenshots
- [ ] compare image
- [ ] wildcard RN versions
- [ ] Android support
- [ ] ability to set target device (sim)
- [ ] "diff runs" ( will check only new RN versions etc)
- [ ] more flexible configuration options
