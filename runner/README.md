# react-native-snap-shooter
The aim of this library is to allow take snap shots of your simple demo application in various React Native versions in simplified way.

The most common use case for this library is to **test that your library works well in various RN versions**.
Since RN is developed rapidly (which is good thing on one side) it comes with breaking changes from time to time.
That can be changes to API (which cause malfunction directly but usually is more obvious) or changes to layouting.

Since it is lot of effort to test your library in all version we made this tool that do it for you by **comparing snap shots** between RN versions.
